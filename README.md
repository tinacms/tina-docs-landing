## üåê Production Setup

### **Step 3: Set Up GitHub and TinaCloud**

1. **Add your docs to GitHub**: Push your local repository to GitHub if you haven't already
2. **Create a TinaCloud account**: Sign up at [app.tina.io](https://app.tina.io)
3. **Link your repository**: Connect your GitHub repository to TinaCloud through the dashboard

### **Step 4: Configure Environment**

1. Rename `.env.example` to `.env`
2. Add your Tina credentials:

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_TINA_CLIENT_ID=<get this from app.tina.io>
TINA_TOKEN=<get this from app.tina.io>
NEXT_PUBLIC_TINA_BRANCH=<your content branch>
NEXT_PUBLIC_ENABLE_THEME_SELECTION=<dispaly theme selector>
```

**Theme Preview Mode:**
To enable a theme selector in the UI for previewing all themes, add:
```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_ENABLE_THEME_SELECTION=true
```

> üí° **Note:** The theme selector allows you to preview different themes in real-time, but these changes are temporary and won't persist when you open a new browser window/tab. To make a theme permanent, update the `Selected Them` field in your Settings through TinaCMS.
